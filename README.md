Developed a Signup App using NodeJs and Expressjs
I discovered how to use the get method to generate various web pages from a backend web server when a user accesses them, as well as how to use the post method to collect input from an HTML element's "form" field.
JavaScript, HTML, CSS, NodeJS, and expressjs were the technologies used.
